### Stochastic squirrels

The notebook `stochastic-squirrels.ipynb` runs a simple simulation of a squirrel population 
in decline. 

Code features
- NumPy random number generators
- Using pandas dataframes to run many simulations simultaneously (vectorized)
- Nice plots with overlapping data 

Math features
- Squirrel population declines using a binomial distribution (rate = 0.5, n = current squirrels)
- More trials means more consistent behavior
